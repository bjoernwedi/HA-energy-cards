# HA-energy-cards
my way to clean graph cards without specific development based on default custom cards

## Where it started
While I was applying photovoltaik to my house and started also with a battery for the nights, I had home assistant already installed for many devices, but also smart gardening and irrigation.
Because i then started using an EV and applied a wallbox at home, the energy chapter in one place became a topic.
Unsatisfyingly home assistant did not give me the apperance I liked to have to combine solar panel production, battery management, wallbox, car. at least not out of the box.
Due to the need of some reconstruction in my power distribution, I had the opportunity to als apply some energy meters per floor.

Finally the idea for a new dashboard with default layout tiles was born to bring all these different digital inputs together.

A card having the visual representation of the meter, the days measurement, the last days one, the actual value, a specific dynamic state, icon and color.
